# SuiteCRM

Installing SuiteCRM 8.7.1.

There isn't much user-friendly documentation available for easily installing this great CRM, so I created a tested SuiteCRM installation script that will allow you to install it on a Linux computer or a virtual Linux machine in under 10 minutes.

See [installation.md](/installation.md) for the step-by-step instruction.

Also [you may want to see this video](https://youtu.be/eycqCChZ8nI) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaQOt6sfhwQ).

      NOTE: I am not affiliated with the SuiteCRM team, nor am I being supported by them.
